Another group project that I worked on as a web developer in a team to fulfill my graduation from a Fundamental Software Development course.

The technology used to build this project are:
- JavaScript as Programming Language.
- EJS for HTML templating engine.
- Express JS as back end framework.
- Tailwind CSS to creating UI's.
- MySQL for database.
